How to Use:

1. Clone or Download the Repository:

2. Add Your Songs:
   
- Navigate to the songs folder.
- Each subfolder represents an album or playlist (for example, Bollywood, Arijit_singh).
- To add your own album or playlist:
  1. Create a new folder inside songs/ (for example, MyAlbum).
  2. Add a cover.jpg (album cover image).
  3. Add an info.json file with the following:
     {
      "title": "My Album Title",
      "description": "A short description of the album"
     }
  4.Place your .mp3 files inside this folder.

Note: The app will automatically detect and display any new albums/playlists you add. Just refresh the page to see your new music!

3. Run the Project

- Open index.html in your web browser.
- No server setup is required for basic usage. For full functionality (like fetching local files), use a local server, such as: VSCode Live Server, Python: python -m http.server, Node: npx http-server.

4. Browse and Play

- Click on any album to view its songs.
- Click a song to play it.
